  <h1>Principles of Design</h1>
  <p> Reddit does a great job of utilizing the principles of design.
    The site does a very good job mapping its controls and not having
    multiple functions for the same buttons, creating a sort of rythm on
     the page.  On the other hand, there is a button that you can press
     that shows the post's picture (if the post has a picture) without
     loading a new web page that also closes the post if you press it again.
       The way that the content is grouped together makes it easy for the
        user to read it without having too much information in one place
         and gives the page a pattern and a sense of unity.  It also
          helps the user understand what content goes with what.  The
           signal-to-noise ratio on Reddit makes it very easy for the
            user to quickly find what he/she is looking for, as the user
             can quickly move his or her eyes through the page.  The layout
              is very basic and easy on the eyes which makes the signal-to-noise
               ratio very high.  Reddit is also balanced very well with its
                colors and the way that it utilizes the rule of thirds.  This
                 makes the design of the website appealing to look at.  The
                  screenshot below is an example of the basic layout for all
                   of Reddit's subreddits (sub-pages for different subjects)
                    and relates to the all of these principles of design.</p>
